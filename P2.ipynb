    "## How does it work?\n",
    "Glow lowers a traditional neural network dataflow graph into a two-phase strongly-typed [intermediate representation](https://github.com/pytorch/glow/blob/master/docs/IR.md) (IR). The high-level IR allows the optimizer to perform domain-specific optimizations. The lower-level instruction-based address-only IR allows the compiler to perform memory-related optimizations, such as instruction scheduling, static memory allocation and copy elimination. At the lowest level, the optimizer performs machine-specific code generation to take advantage of specialized hardware features. Glow features a lowering phase which enables the compiler to support a high number of input operators as well as a large number of hardware targets by eliminating the need to implement all operators on all targets. The lowering phase is designed to reduce the input space and allow new hardware backends to focus on a small number of linear algebra primitives. The design philosophy is described in an [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00907) paper."
