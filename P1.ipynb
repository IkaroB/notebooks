    "# Open Neural Network eXchange â€” A Standard for ML Interoperability\n",
    "In 2017, AWS, Microsoft, and Facebook came together to launch the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), which defines a standard for ML interoperability. ONNX has two components: a common set of operators and a common file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators are the building blocks of machine learning and deep learning models. By standardizing a common set of operators, ONNX makes it easy to consume deep learning models trained in any of the supported frameworks. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types.\n"

    "The common file format of ONNX becomes the lowest common denominator to represent a model. Once a model is exported to ONNX, irrespective of the framework it is trained in, it exposes a standard graph and set of operators based on the specification. Every model is converted into a standard intermediate representation (IR) that is well-defined and well-documented.\n",
    "\n",
    "By providing a common representation of the computation graph, ONNX helps developers choose the right framework for their task, allows authors to focus on innovative enhancements, and enables hardware vendors to streamline optimizations for their platforms."
